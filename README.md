# YGOPro4
UPDATED: 12/17/2019

Welcome to my YGOPro Github.

Please be warned that these are written with YGOPro 1.034 in mind. Some MAY work on previous versions with exceptions.

# ANNOUNCEMENT

As of 12/17, I am currently in the process of moving my cards over to 9-digit passcodes in an attempt to avoid having collisions with Konami IDs. They will be listed as 233xxxxxx (which should generally be fine). The following is also true.
- Archetypes will be shifted around a bit to group similar archetypes together (least in the sense of where their origins lie)
- Cards that have not been coded will be stricken from the roster in the new additions, so you may see less cards altogether.

I will keep the original files as archival if required.

# Disclaimer

I am fully aware that a lot of the cards here are one or more of the following on this list.

1. Lack of pictures or using filler ones thereof, though I am working on finding/creating non-filler ones. (Please do not confuse cards with similar arts in the meantime.)
2. Coding is broken somewhere or has not been updated. (There are some cards that I have not touched for a while.)
3. Code does not match up with the actual effects on card due to difficulties/issues with the core at this time. (Remember, I am not a developer for the game, so I do not know what is going on.)
4. Cards do not have coding at all, either due to my own inability to write the code or the YGOPro core at present does not support something of the sort.

In line with the updates, I am removing cards from the .cdb which do not have code as to avoid having "blanks" that you cannot use. They will eventually be added back over time.

# General stuff
- If anything is amiss (code is broken, pictures need fixing, etc), message me on Discord @Sakura#2014
- Do NOT change any of the code / CDB files on your own; otherwise, things will break. (However, if you would like to help, that would be greatly appreciated. Just submit a pull request or something to the file and I'll approve it.)
* Use the Sakura Card Database.cdb file for your files; it ªs less files than having all of the archetypes individually in their own CDBs. However, if you would prefer the multiple files, let me know.

# Archetypes and Codes

See "Set ID.xlsx" for the list. Please note that I may not update it as periodically as I do with the card files.
