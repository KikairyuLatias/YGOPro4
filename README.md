# YGOPro4
UPDATED: 9/2/2020

Welcome to my YGOPro Github.

# ANNOUNCEMENT

As of April 5, 2020, please be warned that I have switched gears into coding using ED0Pro stuff as YGOPro will no longer be functional / receive updates.

For those who require the old files, please check "back code (YGOPro)", though be mindful that I may not always update it. Though barring Pendulum, Rituals and Extra Deck monsters with materials, some of the ED0Pro stuff can be used.

# ANNOUNCEMENT 2

https://sites.google.com/view/sakuracarddesign/home

You may use this site for updates, card lists and for sending me inquiries via the Google Form. I'll try to update this more than I would with the text file.

What's available on this site?
- Announcement log
- General descriptions of archetypes/series
- Archetype ranges and codes
- Individual cards (sometimes needs to be updated)
- Support form if you need it

# Disclaimer

I am fully aware that a lot of the cards here are one or more of the following on this list.

1. Lack of pictures or using filler ones thereof, though I am working on finding/creating non-filler ones. (Please do not confuse cards with similar arts in the meantime.)
2. Coding is broken somewhere or has not been updated. (There are some cards that I have not touched for a while.)
3. Code does not match up with the actual effects on card due to difficulties/issues with the core at this time. (Remember, I am not a developer for the game, so I do not know what is going on.) Furthermore, note that EDOPro runs on OCG rulings, which may differ from what is enforced in the TCG.
4. Cards do not have coding at all, either due to my own inability to write the code or the EDOPro core at present does not support something of the sort.

In line with the updates, I am removing cards from the .cdb which do not have code as to avoid having "blanks" that you cannot use. They will eventually be added back over time.

# General stuff
- If anything is amiss (code is broken, pictures need fixing, etc), message me on Discord @Sakura#2014
- Do NOT change any of the code / CDB files on your own; otherwise, things will break. (However, if you would like to help, that would be greatly appreciated. Just submit a pull request or something to the file and I'll approve it.)
* Use the Sakura Card Database.cdb file for your files; it ªs less files than having all of the archetypes individually in their own CDBs. However, if you would prefer the multiple files, let me know.
