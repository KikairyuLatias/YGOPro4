# YGOPro4
Welcome to my YGOPro Github with all of my stuff.

Please be warned that these are written with YGOPro 1.034 in mind. Some MAY work on previous versions with exceptions.

# Disclaimer

I am fully aware that a lot of the cards here are one or more of the following on this list.

1. Lack of pictures or using filler ones thereof, though I am working on finding/creating non-filler ones. (Please do not confuse cards with similar arts in the meantime.)
2. Coding is broken somewhere or has not been updated. (There are some cards that I have not touched for a while.)
3. Code does not match up with the actual effects on card due to difficulties/issues with the core at this time. (Remember, I am not a developer for the game, so I do not know what is going on.)
4. Cards do not have coding at all, either due to my own inability to write the code or the YGOPro core at present does not support something of the sort.

# General stuff
- If anything is amiss (code is broken, pictures need fixing, etc), message me on Discord @Sakura#2014
- Do NOT change any of the code / CDB files on your own; otherwise, things will break. (However, if you would like to help, that would be greatly appreciated. Just submit a pull request or something to the file and I'll approve it.)
* Use the Sakura Card Database.cdb file for your files; it ªs less files than having all of the archetypes individually in their own CDBs. However, if you would prefer the multiple files, let me know.

# Archetypes and Codes

See "Set ID.xlsx" for the list. Please note that I may not update it as periodically as I do with the card files.

My cards are indexed as 9000xxxx for the most part, however many of them are hard coded. I am currently editing the codes to be softer and able to move around if I need to make modifications (i.e. Konami makes a card that falls into this range).

If I need tp move cards around to 9-digit passcodes (which may be likely), they will be uploaded as such. The older files may still remain, but please delete them as you download the newest versions.

(I apologize for the inconvenience in not deleting the older files, however this becomes a legitimate headache to do on browser)
