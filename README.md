# YGOPro4
All of my custom YGOPro stuff. 

Please be warned that these are written with YGOPro 1.034 and beyond in mind. Some MAY work on previous versions with exceptions.

# Disclaimer

I am fully aware that a lot of the cards here are one or more of the following on this list.
1. Lack of pictures or using filler ones thereof. (Please do not confuse cards with similar artwork)
2. Coding is broken somewhere or has not been updated (as all of the coding was originally written in 1.033V7-2 (from 2015)
3. Code does not match up with the actual effects on card due to difficulties/issues with the core at this time.
4. Cards do not have coding at all, due to technical difficulties with coding at the present time (either core or my own inability)

# Uploading schedule

To be determined based on free time. Please note that I'm an engineering major with my own work, NOT a programming/computer science major. I will do the best I can, but no guarantees.

I'll try for maybe every 3-7 days, time permitting.

# General stuff
- If anything is amiss (code is broken, pictures need fixing, etc), message me on Discord @Sakura#2014
- Do NOT claim that you made these cards.
- Don't change any of the codes or the script, otherwise your program will crash and cards don't work.
* Use the Sakura Card Database.cdb file for your files; it ªs less files than having all of the archetypes individually. If you would like them individually, let me know and I can go back to doing that. (Also easier for me at times...)
